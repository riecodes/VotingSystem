2. Data Storage: CSV files for persistence
3. Authentication: Passwords will be hashed (not plain text)
4. GUI Theme: Modern JavaFX look with CSS styling
5. Language: English only
6. Additional Features/Constraints: None beyond the plan

# Progress Update: GUI and Controller Integration Complete

- All main FXML screens (login, dashboard, voting, results, admin/candidate management, audit log) are implemented with modern layouts.
- Corresponding JavaFX controllers are implemented and integrated with VotingSystemManager business logic.
- Navigation, data flow, and user actions are connected and functional.

Next steps: Test navigation and data flow, polish error handling and UI/UX, update documentation (README.md and Memory.txt).
---

1. Project Understanding and Scope Definition
1.1. Project Overview
- Goal: Develop a secure, user-friendly Voting System using JavaFX (FXML) that demonstrates OOP, event-driven programming, file handling, and robust GUI design.
- Target Users: Election administrators, voters, and system auditors.
- Key Features: Voter registration, candidate management, secure voting, result computation, and audit logging.

1.2. Functional Requirements
- User Roles: Admin, Voter
- Core Modules:
  - User Authentication (Login/Logout)
  - Voter Registration & Validation
  - Candidate Management (CRUD)
  - Voting Process (One vote per user, real-time validation)
  - Results Display (Live and Final)
  - Data Export/Import (CSV/JSON/XML)
  - Audit Trail (Action logging for security)

1.3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: Data encryption, input validation, access control.
- Usability: Intuitive navigation, clear instructions, error feedback.
- Performance: Fast response, efficient file handling.
- Maintainability: Modular code, clear documentation, use of design patterns.

2. Object-Oriented Design (OOP) Analysis
2.1. Class Structure
- Core Classes:
  - User (abstract): Fields for username, password, role; methods for authentication.
  - Voter (extends User): Additional fields (voterID, hasVoted), methods for voting.
  - Admin (extends User): Methods for managing candidates, viewing results.
  - Candidate: Fields for candidateID, name, party, voteCount.
  - Vote: Fields for voterID, candidateID, timestamp.
  - AuditLog: Fields for action, user, timestamp, details.
- Design Patterns: Singleton (for system manager), Factory (for user creation), Observer (for result updates), MVC (Model-View-Controller separation).

2.2. Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Encapsulation: Private fields, public getters/setters, validation in setters.
- Inheritance: User → Voter/Admin; shared logic in base class.
- Polymorphism: Overriding methods (e.g., performAction() in Admin/Voter).

3. Event-Driven Programming (EDP) Analysis
3.1. Event Handling
- JavaFX Event Listeners: Button clicks (vote, register, login), menu navigation, form submissions.
- Custom Events: Voting completed, results updated, user registered.
- FXML Integration: Use of @FXML annotations for controller methods.

3.2. User Interaction Flow
- Login → Dashboard → Voting/Candidate Management → Results → Logout
- Error Handling: Try-catch blocks for all user actions, with user-friendly error messages.

4. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Analysis
4.1. Screen Design
- Login Screen: Username, password fields, role selection.
- Dashboard: Role-based navigation (Admin/Voter).
- Voter Screens: Registration, voting, confirmation, results.
- Admin Screens: Candidate CRUD, voter list, results, audit logs.
- Common Elements: Menu bar, status bar, help/about dialogs.

4.2. Layout and Usability
- FXML Layouts: Use of GridPane, BorderPane, VBox, HBox for structured design.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, tooltips, high-contrast mode.
- Feedback: Success/error dialogs, progress indicators.

5. File Handling and Data Persistence
5.1. Data Storage
- File Types: Use CSV or JSON for storing users, candidates, votes, and logs.
- Serialization: Java serialization for object persistence (if needed).
- File Operations: BufferedReader/Writer for efficient I/O.

5.2. Data Integrity and Security
- Validation: Check for duplicate votes, valid user credentials, candidate existence.
- Backup/Restore: Manual and automatic backup options.

6. Data Validation and Exception Handling
6.1. Input Validation
- Forms: Validate all user inputs (e.g., no empty fields, valid formats).
- Voting Logic: Ensure one vote per voter, valid candidate selection.

6.2. Exception Handling
- Try-Catch Blocks: Wrap all file and user operations.
- Logging: Record exceptions in audit log for review.

7. User Experience (UX) and Navigation
7.1. Navigation Structure
- Main Menu: Clear options for each user role.
- Breadcrumbs: Indicate current location in the app.
- Help/Support: In-app help section or tooltips.

7.2. Screen Flow
- At least three main screens: Dashboard, Voting/Candidate Management, Results/Audit Logs.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance
8.1. Unit Testing
- JUnit Tests: For core logic (voting, registration, file handling).

8.2. Integration Testing
- Scenario Tests: Simulate full voting process, admin management, error cases.

8.3. User Acceptance Testing
- Feedback: Collect feedback from test users for usability improvements.

9. Documentation and Submission
9.1. Project Documentation
- Overview: System purpose, features, architecture diagram.
- Class Diagrams: UML for OOP structure.
- Sequence Diagrams: For key workflows (voting, registration).
- Screenshots: Of all main screens and workflows.
- File Handling Explanation: How data is stored, loaded, and validated.
- OOP/EDP Concepts: Where and how they are applied.

9.2. Demo Video
- Content: System walkthrough, feature highlights, error handling demo.

9.3. Presentation
- Slides: Project goals, design, demo, challenges, and lessons learned.

10. Future Enhancements (Optional, for extra credit)
- Database Integration: Switch from file-based to database storage.
- Networked Voting: Support for remote voting sessions.
- Advanced Security: Two-factor authentication, encryption.
- Analytics: Voting statistics, turnout graphs.
