# Interactive System or Game Application Development Using Object-Oriented and Event-Driven Programming Concepts

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and developing an interactive system or game application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Event-Driven Programming (EDP) concepts in Java. The project requires the application of Java Swing for GUI development, event handling, file handling, and OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Project Foundation & User Preferences (Confirmed)

- **User Roles:** Admin and Voter only
- **Data Storage:** CSV files for persistence
- **Authentication:** Passwords are hashed
- **GUI Theme:** Modern JavaFX look with CSS styling
- **Language:** English only
- **Additional Features/Constraints:** None beyond the plan

## Objectives
- Apply OOP concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Implement event-driven programming using event listeners (ActionListener, MouseListener, KeyListener, etc.).
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing components (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, etc.).
- Integrate file-handling mechanisms (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, serialization) for data storage and retrieval.
- Ensure data validation and error handling using exception handling techniques (try-catch).
- Create an engaging user experience with interactive elements, a user-friendly interface, and clear navigation.

## Instructions
### 1. Project Scope
Form a group (max 2) and develop an interactive system or game application that demonstrates OOP, event-driven programming, and file-handling concepts. The project must have a GUI and respond to user inputs through events.

#### System Examples
- Inventory Management System
- Student Information System
- Library Management System
- Employee Payroll System
- Hotel Reservation System

#### Game Examples
- E-Learning Games
- Simple RPG or Adventure Game

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Object-Oriented Design:** At least three classes demonstrating inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Use Java Swing components (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JTable, etc.).
- **Event Handling:** Handle user inputs via event-driven programming (ActionListener, MouseListener, KeyListener).
- **File Handling:** Implement data persistence using file handling (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, Object Serialization).
- **User Data Management:** Save and load user data (e.g., game progress, records, system entries).
- **Error Handling:** Include exception handling (try-catch blocks) for invalid inputs or errors.
- **User Interaction:** Provide interactive elements for user actions and feedback.

### 3. Interface and User Experience
- The main menu must have navigation buttons or options to access different features.
- The GUI must be user-friendly, with clear labels, instructions, and a well-structured layout (GridLayout, BorderLayout, etc.).
- The application should include at least three different screens, such as:
  - For Systems: Dashboard, Data Entry Form, Reports
  - For Games: Menu, Gameplay, Settings

### 4. Submission Requirements
- **Source Code:** All Java files and assets
- **Project Documentation:**
  - Project overview
  - System/game features
  - OOP/EDP concepts applied
  - File-handling implementation
  - Screenshots
- **Demo Video:** Short video showcasing how the system/game works
- **Presentation:** Each group will present their project for 5-10 minutes
